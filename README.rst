scholarly (edited)
=========

I've edited the scholarly module to retrieve specific author and publication
information from `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com>`__ using Python.

Installation
------------

``pip`` to install from github:

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/zieglerjef/scholarly.git

or clone the package using git:

::

    git clone https://github.com/zieglerjef/scholarly.git
